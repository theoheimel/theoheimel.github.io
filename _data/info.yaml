aboutme: |-
  I am a postdoctoral researcher in particle physics and machine learning at the
  [Centre for Cosmology, Particle Physics and Phenomenology](
  https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/irmp/cp3) in Louvain-la-Neuve.
  The main focus of my research is accelerating event
  generation for the High-Luminosity LHC and beyond using generative networks. In particular, the
  [MadNIS](https://madnis.ai) project aims to make sampling hard-scattering events in
  [MadGraph](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo) faster using neural importance sampling.
  Furthermore, I am interested in ML-based methods to extract more information from LHC data.
  This includes unfolding with generative networks, simulation-based inference, and combining
  machine-learned detector effects with theory knowledge in the matrix element method.
